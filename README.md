# Arcade Game Project

This is a browser-based arcade game, which creates a great opportunity to practice JavaScriptâ€™s object-oriented programming.

## Instructions

Clone the GitHub repository and open index.html file in a modern web browser to run the game.

`git clone https://github.com/andyyang/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game`

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water and collect as many gems as possible, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

Each turn:

- You can use the left key and the right key to select a character image for the player, and then press the space key or the enter key to start the game.
- The player can move left, right, up and down when you press the left key, right key, up key and down key. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.
- There are some gems on the paved block portion of the scene. You can move the player to collect these gems. The score can increase by 10 each time the player collects a gem.
- Once the player reaches the water, the score can increase by 5 and the player moves back to the start square.
- You have 60 seconds to play the game. So you try to get the highest score in the 60 seconds.
- Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is over and you can press the space key or the enter key to restart the game.
